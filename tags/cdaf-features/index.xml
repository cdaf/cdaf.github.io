      <description>Configuration Mapping The local and remote configuration will trigger a task execution based on each unique declaration of context and target, using the corresponding default task tasksRunLocal.tsk and tasksRunLocal.tsk.
context target deployHost remote UAT vm.example.com local UAT vm.example.com remote PROD vm.example.com local PROD vm.example.com Customer tasks can be defined for directories customLocal and customRemote respectively, or custom if shared.
context target deployTaskOverride local DOCKER docker-compose-test.tsk remote UAT on-premise-deploy.tsk remote PROD on-premise-deploy.</description>

      <description>containerBuild Some CI/CD pipeline toolsets support native capability (GitLab, BitBucket) to execute with a container. In other some cases, (CircleCI, Travis) all pipeline activity can only be executed within containers.
For toolsets which do not support this functionality, but do allow for self-hosted agents or where a self-hosted agent is preferred/mandated i.e. execution within a private network, the CDAF container helpers can provide consistency for construction, execution and housekeeping.
Even with a toolset uses containers, if they support docker-in-docker, the CDAF container helpers can still be utilised.</description>

      <description>containerBuild Master of Build Success The containerBuild option allows the execution of the build process from within a container. Unlike toolsets which reference a image that is used to create the build container, CDAF uses a Dockerfile, for the following advantages:
 Build Prerequisites can be defined in code, without being limited to available published images Once constructed the image image cache provides improved performance, without having to use a image registry Working directory and user home directory are volume mounted, to allow caching of build dependencies, e.</description>

      <title>Execution Engine</title>
      <link>https://cdaf.io/90-reference/20-feature-configuration/20-execution-engine/</link>

      <guid>https://cdaf.io/90-reference/20-feature-configuration/20-execution-engine/</guid>
      <description>Execution Engine To alleviate the burden of argument passing, exception handling and logging, the execution engine has been provided. The execution engine will essentially execute the native interpretive language (PowerShell or bash), line by line, but each execution will be tested for exceptions (trivial in bash, significantly more complex in PowerShell).
Where is it used In all places using .tsk files, i.e. build, package, wrap and deploy. The following operations are available to all tasks, however, some are more applicable to specific processes, see Build, Local and Remote task execution for more details of how these can be used.</description>

      <title>Environment Variables</title>
      <link>https://cdaf.io/90-reference/20-feature-configuration/30-environment-variables/</link>

      <description>Environment Variables Due to inconsistencies between Windows and Linux handling of environment variables, these have been divided between environment variables that are set before calling an entry script to alter the behaviour of CDAF, and environment variables that are set within bash scripts to make them globally available.
Control Variables The following environment variables are available to control the behaviour of CDAF
   Variable Description     CDAF_BRANCH_NAME Used by entry.</description>

      <guid>https://cdaf.io/90-reference/30-docker-features/30-image-build/</guid>
      <description>imageBuild This helper script supports the creation of docker images, and conditionally, the pushing of that image to a registry.
Container Build Configuration To execute, define the buildImage definition. Note: complete definitions are provided in the GitHub samples for Windows and Linux.
The following samples have the default process commented out, and can be used to define a custom process.
Windows buildImage=cdaf/windows # imageBuild=&amp;amp; &amp;quot;$AUTOMATIONROOT/remote/imageBuild.ps1&amp;quot; ${SOLUTION}_${REVISION} ${BUILDNUMBER} Linux buildImage=cdaf/linux # imageBuild=&amp;quot;$AUTOMATIONROOT/remote/imageBuild.</description>

      <description>containerDeploy Like containerBuild, containerDeploy provides both image build and container task execution. The common use for container deploy where a command line interface is required.
Master of Deployment Success The containerDeploy option allows the execution of the deploy process from within a container. Unlike toolsets which reference a image that is used to create the deploy container, CDAF uses a Dockerfile, for the following advantages:
 Deploy Prerequisites can be defined in code, without being limited to available published images Once constructed the image image cache provides improved performance, without having to use a image registry  Container Deploy Configuration To execute the deploy within a container, add the containerDeploy definition and runtimeImage (if not supplied, containerImage will be used) to CDAF.</description>

      <description>Solution Properties CDAF.solution : file to identify a directory as the automation solution directory where the key configuration files are placed. This file is used as the bases of the manifest.txt file while is included in the resulting CI artefact package.

      <description>dockerPush Using the same logic after imageBuild, this utility script provides simple login and push logic.
The script can be called passing arguments
./dockerPush.ps1 $TARGET_TAG cdaf/${SOLUTION} &amp;quot;${artifactPrefix}.${BUILDNUMBER} latest&amp;quot; $DOCKERHUB_TOKEN cdaf This example uses an environment variable (complete list follows) to set the URL. The registry in this example does not require authentication.
export CDAF_PUSH_REGISTRY_URL=hub.private.registry ./dockerPush.sh ${SOLUTION}_master_target:${BUILDNUMBER} ${SOLUTION} ${BUILDNUMBER} Available environment variables
   Variable Description     CDAF_PUSH_REGISTRY_URL Image registry URL, example myregistry.</description>

      <title>Feature Branch Execution</title>

      <description>Feature Branch Execution Place feature-branch.properties in your SOLUTIONROOT to allow dynamic delivery execution, based on Git Branch name. This capability is limited to entry.sh/entry.bat/entry.ps1, which are Git aware, and the recommended loose coupling entry scripts for CDAF.

      <title>Sensitive Data Strategies</title>
      <link>https://cdaf.io/90-reference/20-feature-configuration/70-sensitive-data-strategies/</link>

      <description>Sensitive Data Strategies Loose Coupling A key approach to support the principle of automation execution in a local desktop context, is the use of environment variables. It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that environment variables do not necessarily need to be persisted, i.e. stored unencrypted on disk, it&amp;rsquo;s the global availability of the variable that makes it an environment variable.

      <title>Legacy Features</title>
      <link>https://cdaf.io/90-reference/20-feature-configuration/80-legacy-features/</link>

      <guid>https://cdaf.io/90-reference/20-feature-configuration/80-legacy-features/</guid>
      <description>Legacy Features Remote Deployment Machine to machine deployments are increasingly uncommon, as local agents/runners are readily available, making on-premise deployments from the build server an infrequent use case. While there is no plan to deprecate this capability, it&amp;rsquo;s complexity makes local testing i.e. shift-left complicated, especially in windows. For CDAF configuration, see Remote Tasks.
Windows Remote PowerShell This approach uses the local host for both target (CD) and build (CI) execution.</description>
